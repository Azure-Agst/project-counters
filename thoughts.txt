Alright i'm done for the night. For tomorrow:

- make sure to finish the admin console
- create volunteer checkin page
    - Admin would create event in table `future`, with name, start time, and end time.
    - When active, index will show live point tally
    - when done, admin can verify point values then php will transfer values to testpts.
    - see paper for more details.
- start customizing CSS depending on what house the user is in
