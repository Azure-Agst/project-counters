            <p>Hey there everybody!</p>
            <p>My name's Andrew Augustine, and I'm the Creator and Senior Software Engineer on Project Counters, an initiative to move the St. John Paul II High Schools house points tracking system to the cloud. In case you have no idea what i'm talking about, take a look around the site. Or keep reading. Your choice. </p>
            <p>The website's barebones right now. The main page shows the current point values, you can sign up for an account to track yout point earnage, and it tailors the page to you. There's also a whole administration console done for admin users to manage events and make the whole thing seamless, with no database management required.</p>
            <p>For the most part, the hardest part of the project is done. Over the course of ten days I just sat down and got most of the programming done. Now, I'm looking for a team to help me improve what I have, expand the project, and come up with new ideas for it. Each of these positions earns you a snazzy title, and my undying gratefulness for joining the team. They're all part-time, and can work around your schedule. We're pretty flexible here, so if you have a job or stuff, we can work with you to make sure you can still help out and recieve full recognition for the project. Currently each of the available positions are labelled below, and with my requirements for each position. If you're interested in it at all, please let me know.</p>
            <p>Thanks! <i>-Andrew</i></p>
