# Project Counters

see [here](http://aws.azureagst.pw/points/) for a live version. (or as live as it'll get)

---------------------------------------

changed to hosting the project on git rather than the live server. good for simple changes and working locally. for backend work that requires testing with MySQL, you can use the actual test server for that.

other than that here's all the files. knock yourselves out.
